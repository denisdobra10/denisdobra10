# About Me:
Alongside my academic journey, I broadened my horizons through a Work and Travel program, immersing myself in the diverse landscape of the USA. This experience not only enhanced my English fluency but also nurtured my adaptability and cross-cultural communication skills.

Combining my international exposure with rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, I've cultivated strong analytical and problem-solving abilities, making me well-equipped to excel in the dynamic realm of IT.
